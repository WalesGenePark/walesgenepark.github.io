# New Patient Support Network Launched

Wales Gene Park is pleased to announce the launch of a new patient support network designed to connect and empower individuals and families affected by genetic conditions. The network, named "GeneConnect Wales," aims to provide a platform for sharing experiences, accessing resources, and fostering a sense of community.

## Network Features

- Online forums moderated by healthcare professionals
- Monthly virtual meetups with guest speakers
- Access to educational resources about genetic conditions
- Opportunities to participate in research studies and clinical trials

Sarah Evans, Patient Engagement Coordinator at Wales Gene Park, explained, "Living with a genetic condition can be challenging and isolating. GeneConnect Wales aims to bring people together, providing mutual support and access to expert information."

The network is open to all patients and families in Wales affected by genetic conditions, regardless of the specific diagnosis. It will also serve as a valuable resource for healthcare providers seeking to better understand the patient experience.
